<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
    - You'll be able to see my demo at Netify, one of the free hosting websites. 
- What was your experience?
    - My experience was that this was a fairly easy project to do, espexially with the design figma file to help with speciifc measurements. 
- What have you learned/improved?
    - What I learned from this project was how to handle the box-sizing style border box. I know that border box is most used in the idustry so this wa sa perfect way to practice it. 
- Your wisdom?
    - When working with websites, the best thing you can do is practice practice practice. Just start and you'll see it's not as scary as it seems.
